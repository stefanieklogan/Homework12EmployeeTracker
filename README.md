* Schema and seeds files are available and should be executed prior to application use. 

* To run the application, enter 'node index.js' inside terminal.

## Notes

* I realize the delete employee functionality has a hiccup as it will not execute the console log and final function. I have validated the code does update the employee table in MySQL. I did bring this matter to my tutor's attention and neither of us were able to deBug. I'd be curious if anyone has pointers.
